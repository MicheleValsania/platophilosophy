      <h1 style="margin-top:8px;">Later Years</h1>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        After his final return from Sicily in 360 BC, Plato devoted himself entirely to the Academy. He was nearly seventy years old. His major works — the <em>Republic</em>, <em>Symposium</em>, <em>Phaedo</em> — were already written. Now he turned to more technical, self-critical dialogues.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        The late dialogues — <em>Theaetetus</em>, <em>Parmenides</em>, <em>Sophist</em>, <em>Statesman</em>, <em>Philebus</em>, <em>Timaeus</em>, and the unfinished <em>Laws</em> — are different in tone. They are less dramatic, more abstract. Socrates appears less frequently, and when he does, he is often not the main speaker.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        These works show Plato wrestling with problems in his own philosophy. The <em>Parmenides</em> raises objections to the Theory of Forms so devastating that scholars still debate whether Plato meant them seriously or ironically. The <em>Timaeus</em> offers a cosmological myth that tries to bridge the gap between eternal Forms and the changing physical world.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        The <em>Laws</em>, Plato's longest work, was left unfinished at his death. It describes a "second-best" city — not the ideal Republic, but a realistic constitution that could actually be implemented. It is more pragmatic, less utopian. Perhaps Plato had learned from his failures in Syracuse.
      </p>
      <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">Teaching and legacy</h2>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        Plato continued to teach at the Academy until his death. Aristotle, his most famous student, remained there until Plato's passing, though their philosophical views diverged over time. When Plato died, Aristotle did not succeed him as scholarch — that honor went to Plato's nephew Speusippus.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:78ch;line-height:1.7;color:rgba(255,255,255,.78)">
        In his final years, Plato had achieved something rare: institutional immortality. His writings would survive. His school would continue for centuries. His method — dialectic, questioning, the search for definitions — would become the foundation of Western philosophy.
