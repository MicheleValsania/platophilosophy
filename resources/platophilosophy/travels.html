      <div class="hr"></div>
      <article class="reading">
        <p>After Socrates' execution in 399 BC, Plato left Athens. He may have feared for his own safety — Socrates' associates were suspect, and Athens was still politically unstable. But the departure was also intellectual: he needed distance, perspective, and new teachers.</p>
        <p>For the next twelve years, Plato traveled. These were not leisure trips. They were a philosophical education in motion — exposure to different schools of thought, different forms of government, different ways of living. By the time he returned to Athens in 387 BC, Plato was no longer just Socrates' student. He was ready to become a teacher himself.</p>
        
        <h2>Phase 1: Megara (399 BC)</h2>
        <p>The first stop was Megara, a city about 40 kilometers from Athens. Plato went there with other Socratics — Eucleides, Terpsion, and others who had been close to Socrates.</p>
        <p>Eucleides had founded what would later be called the Megarian school. His focus was on logic and dialectic — the art of argument and definition. This was a natural extension of Socratic questioning, but more formal, more rigorous.</p>
        <p>It was probably in Megara that Plato began writing. The <em>Apology</em>, <em>Crito</em>, and perhaps <em>Euthyphro</em> — the early dialogues that preserve Socrates' voice and defend his memory — may have been composed here, while the trial and execution were still fresh.</p>

        <h2>Phase 2: Egypt (397 BC?)</h2>
        <p>According to Diogenes Laertius, Plato traveled to Egypt to study with priests. The Egyptians were renowned for their mathematics and astronomy — disciplines that would become central to Plato's Academy.</p>
        <p>However, some scholars doubt this trip ever happened. There is no mention of Egypt in Plato's own writings, and the evidence is late and unreliable. It may be a legend that grew up later, when philosophers wanted to connect Greek thought to the ancient wisdom of the East.</p>
        <p>True or not, the story reflects something real: Plato's deep interest in mathematics as a foundation for philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Phase 3: Cyrene (North Africa)</h2>
        <p>More certain is Plato's time in Cyrene, where he studied with Theodorus, a renowned mathematician. Theodorus appears as a character in Plato's dialogue <em>Theaetetus</em>, where he discusses the nature of knowledge.</p>
        <p>Cyrene was a Greek colony with a strong intellectual tradition. Studying there would have exposed Plato to mathematical reasoning at the highest level — geometry, number theory, and the idea that truths could be proven, not just argued.</p>

        <h2>Phase 4: Italy and Sicily (388-387 BC)</h2>
        <p>The most important phase of Plato's travels was his visit to southern Italy and Sicily. This trip changed everything.</p>
        <p>In Tarentum (modern Taranto), Plato met <strong>Archytas</strong>, a Pythagorean philosopher and mathematician. The Pythagoreans believed that reality was fundamentally mathematical. Numbers, ratios, and harmonies were not just descriptions of the world — they <em>were</em> the world, at its deepest level.</p>
        <p>They also believed in the immortality of the soul and its transmigration (reincarnation). The body was a prison. Philosophy was the practice of purifying the soul, preparing it for liberation.</p>
        <p>These ideas left a profound mark on Plato. The Theory of Forms — the idea that true reality lies in eternal, unchanging structures beyond the physical world — owes much to Pythagorean influence. So does Plato's emphasis on mathematics in education.</p>

        <div class="journey-box">
          <strong>Key influences from the Pythagoreans:</strong><br/>
          • Mathematics as the key to reality<br/>
          • Immortality and transmigration of the soul<br/>
          • Philosophy as purification<br/>
          • Harmony and proportion as cosmic principles
        </div>

        <h2>The Sicilian disaster</h2>
        <p>From Italy, Plato traveled to Syracuse, the most powerful Greek city in Sicily. It was ruled by Dionysius I, a brilliant but ruthless tyrant.</p>
        <p>In Syracuse, Plato met <strong>Dion</strong>, Dionysius's brother-in-law. Dion was young, idealistic, and fascinated by philosophy. He became Plato's student and, later, lifelong friend.</p>
        <p>Plato hoped to influence Dionysius — to turn him into a philosopher-king, or at least a more just ruler. It was a disaster. Dionysius had no interest in philosophy. Worse, he became suspicious of Plato's influence over Dion.</p>
        <p>According to tradition, Dionysius arranged for Plato to be sold into slavery on the island of Aegina. Plato was only freed when a friend, Anniceris of Cyrene, ransomed him.</p>
        <p>Whether this story is literally true or not, it captures the failure of the mission. Plato had tried to apply philosophy to politics, and politics had rejected him — violently.</p>
        <p>This would not be his last attempt. He would return to Syracuse twice more, in 367 BC and 361 BC, each time hoping to succeed where he had failed before. Each time, he would be disappointed.</p>

        <h2>Return to Athens (387 BC)</h2>
        <p>By 387 BC, Plato was back in Athens. He was about forty years old. He had studied with the best minds of his generation. He had seen different forms of government — democracy, tyranny, oligarchy — and found them all wanting.</p>
        <p>He had absorbed Pythagorean mathematics and cosmology. He had written dialogues that preserved Socrates' legacy. And he had learned, the hard way, that philosophy could not simply enter politics and expect to succeed.</p>
        <p>If the world was going to change, it would require something new: an institution dedicated to training philosophers, mathematicians, and statesmen. A place where truth could be pursued systematically, over generations.</p>
        <p>That institution would be the Academy.</p>
