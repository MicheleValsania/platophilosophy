      <article class="reading">

        <p>
          Plato was born in Athens around 428 or 427 BC, into one of the city's most distinguished families.
          This was not merely wealth — it was lineage that carried political weight and social expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
          His father, <strong>Ariston</strong>, traced his descent from Codrus, the legendary last king of Athens.
          His mother, <strong>Perictione</strong>, was related to Solon, the great lawgiver whose reforms had laid the foundation for Athenian democracy two centuries earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
          These were not idle claims. In aristocratic Athens, family connections mattered deeply.
          To be related to Solon meant inheriting a legacy of political authority and moral seriousness.
          To descend from Codrus — who, according to tradition, sacrificed himself to save Athens — meant embodying civic duty at the highest level.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Siblings and family structure</h2>

        <p>
          Plato had two older brothers: <strong>Adeimantus</strong> and <strong>Glaucon</strong>.
          Both appear as interlocutors in the <em>Republic</em>, Plato's most famous work.
          Their presence in the dialogue is not accidental.
        </p>

        <p>
          Glaucon, in particular, challenges Socrates with some of the most difficult questions in the text: Why be just?
          What if justice is only a social convention? These are the questions a young aristocrat might ask — someone raised to expect privilege and power.
        </p>

        <p>
          Plato also had a sister, <strong>Potone</strong>, whose son Speusippus would later succeed Plato as head of the Academy.
          Philosophy, in this family, was not an individual pursuit but something passed down through generations.
        </p>

        <div class="family-tree">
          <strong>Key Family Connections:</strong><br/>
          <strong>Father:</strong> Ariston (descended from Codrus, last king of Athens)<br/>
          <strong>Mother:</strong> Perictione (related to Solon, the lawgiver)<br/>
          <strong>Brothers:</strong> Adeimantus and Glaucon (appear in <em>Republic</em>)<br/>
          <strong>Sister:</strong> Potone (mother of Speusippus)<br/>
          <strong>Stepfather:</strong> Pyrilampes (after Ariston's death, wealthy friend of Pericles)
        </div>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">The name "Plato"</h2>

        <p>
          According to Diogenes Laertius, Plato's original name may have been Aristocles.
          The name "Platon" (Πλάτων) — meaning "broad" — was supposedly a nickname, referring either to his broad shoulders (from wrestling) or his broad forehead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether this story is true or not, the name fits. Plato was known for his athletic training, and wrestling was a respected part of aristocratic education.
          But "broad" could also describe his intellectual range — a philosopher who would eventually encompass ethics, politics, metaphysics, and cosmology in his work.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Stepfather and political connections</h2>

        <p>
          After Ariston's death (when Plato was still young), Perictione remarried to <strong>Pyrilampes</strong>, a wealthy Athenian with close ties to Pericles.
          This connection brought Plato even closer to the center of Athenian political life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pyrilampes had served as ambassador to Persia and was known for his influence and refinement.
          Growing up in his household, Plato would have been exposed to the highest levels of political conversation and debate — the same debates that would later appear in his dialogues.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Expectations and obligations</h2>

        <p>
          For someone of Plato's background, there was a clear path: education, military service, and eventually a role in public life.
          Aristocratic families expected their sons to lead — either in the Assembly, in the courts, or in positions of civic authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          This expectation is crucial to understanding Plato's later philosophy.
          He did not reject politics because he was indifferent to it.
          He rejected <em>Athenian</em> politics because he believed it had failed — spectacularly — when it executed Socrates in 399 BC.
        </p>

        <p>
          That event would change everything. But even before meeting Socrates, Plato's family had prepared him to think seriously about justice, law, and the proper ordering of the city.
          His aristocratic heritage was not just background — it was the foundation for his entire philosophical project.
        </p>
