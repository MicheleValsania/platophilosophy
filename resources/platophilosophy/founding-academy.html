      </div>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <article class="reading">
        <p>In 387 BC, Plato returned to Athens. He was about forty years old. He had traveled, studied, failed to reform a tyrant, and nearly been sold into slavery. He had learned what philosophy could and could not do.</p>
        <p>Now he would try something different. Instead of entering politics directly, he would train philosophers. Instead of reforming existing cities, he would create an institution that could outlast any single regime.</p>
        <p>He would found the Academy.</p>

        <h2>The site</h2>
        <p>Plato purchased land northwest of Athens, in a grove sacred to the hero <strong>Akademos</strong>. The area was already used for athletic training and public walks — a peaceful space outside the city walls.</p>
        <p>The name "Academy" (Ἀκαδήμεια / <em>Akadēmeia</em>) comes from this grove. It would later become the word for every institution of higher learning in the Western world.</p>
        <p>The Academy was not a "school" in the modern sense. There were no tuition fees, no formal curriculum, no degrees. It was a <em>synousia</em> — a community of people living and thinking together, bound by shared commitment to truth.</p>

        <h2>The model</h2>
        <p>Plato modeled the Academy on the Pythagorean communities he had encountered in Italy. The Pythagoreans lived communally, shared meals, and devoted themselves to mathematics and philosophy as a way of life.</p>
        <p>But Plato's vision was broader. The Academy would not be a religious sect. It would be open to serious inquirers, regardless of background. And it would engage with the world — training future statesmen, advising cities, conducting research in mathematics and astronomy.</p>

        <h2>The inscription</h2>
        <p>According to tradition, an inscription was placed over the entrance to the Academy:</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          Ἀγεωμέτρητος μηδεὶς εἰσίτω<br/>
          <em>Ageōmetrētos mēdeis eisitō</em><br/>
          "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter."
        </div>
        <p>This was not elitism for its own sake. Geometry was essential because it trained the mind to think about eternal, unchanging truths. A triangle's properties do not depend on opinion, politics, or custom. They are the same in Athens and Sicily, now and forever.</p>
        <p>Philosophy required this kind of thinking. If you could not grasp that 2 + 2 = 4 necessarily, you could not grasp that justice is good necessarily. Geometry was <em>propaedeutic</em> — preparatory training for the mind.</p>

        <h2>The curriculum</h2>
        <p>The Academy focused on four main areas:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Mathematics:</strong> Arithmetic, geometry, harmonics, astronomy. These were not just practical skills but windows into the nature of reality itself.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Dialectic:</strong> The art of rigorous argument and definition. Students learned to ask "What is X?" and to test answers through questioning — the Socratic method, systematized.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Natural philosophy:</strong> Cosmology, physics, biology. How is the world structured? What principles govern change and motion?</p>
        <p><strong>4. Political philosophy:</strong> What is justice? What makes a city good? How should power be organized? The Academy trained future legislators and statesmen.</p>

        <h2>Who studied there?</h2>
        <p>The Academy attracted students from across the Greek world. Some stayed for years, becoming part of the community. Others visited briefly to study specific topics.</p>
        <p>The most famous student was <strong>Aristotle</strong>, who joined the Academy around 367 BC at age seventeen and remained for twenty years, until Plato's death. He would later found his own school, the Lyceum, and become one of history's most influential philosophers.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the Academy admitted women — rare in ancient Athens. Two are known by name: <strong>Axiothea</strong> and <strong>Lasthenia</strong>. Both studied alongside men, a testament to Plato's belief that philosophical talent was not limited by gender.</p>

        <h2>Daily life</h2>
        <p>Life at the Academy combined formal study with informal conversation. There were lectures and demonstrations, but also walks, meals, and symposia — the drinking parties where Greeks traditionally debated ideas.</p>
        <p>Plato served as <em>scholarch</em> (head of the school), but the Academy was collaborative. Students contributed to research. Discussions were open-ended. The goal was not to memorize answers but to learn how to think.</p>

        <h2>The legacy</h2>
        <p>Plato led the Academy until his death in 348/347 BC. But the institution outlived him. His nephew Speusippus succeeded him as scholarch. The Academy continued for nearly nine hundred more years, closing only in 529 AD when the Byzantine emperor Justinian shut down pagan schools.</p>
        <p>For almost a millennium, the Academy was a center of learning. It trained mathematicians, astronomers, and philosophers. It preserved Plato's teachings. It demonstrated that philosophy could be institutionalized — that truth-seeking could be organized, sustained, and passed down across generations.</p>
        <p>Every university in the world today is, in some sense, a descendant of Plato's Academy.</p>
