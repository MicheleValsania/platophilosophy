      <article class="reading">

        <p>
          Plato was born in Athens around 428/427 BC, at a moment that could feel like a peak.
          The city had defeated Persia earlier in the century and had become the leading power of the Greek world.
          It was wealthy, confident, and intensely creative. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the Athens of large public buildings, dramatic festivals, and civic ambition.
          The Parthenon was rising on the Acropolis. Theaters filled with tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides.
          Sculptors like Phidias shaped the visual language of what we still call “classical.” :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </p>

        <p>
          But the same city was also entering a long period of strain.
          The Peloponnesian War had begun (431 BC). Sparta and Athens were locked in a conflict that would test
          the democracy, drain resources, and eventually break Athenian dominance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
        </p>

        <p>
          So Plato’s earliest world is defined by a tension:
          <em>greatness</em> on the surface, and <em>instability</em> underneath.
          You can already see why later questions about justice, education, and political order would feel urgent.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">A bold experiment: democracy</h2>

        <p>
          Athens was proud of its democracy, but it was also an experiment — admired by some, criticized by others.
          Political power depended on persuasion and public speech.
          That made education and rhetoric extremely valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, democracy created fear: fear of disorder, fear of demagoguery, fear that popular opinion could become law.
          These anxieties were real even before Athens lost the war.
          Plato would grow up watching how quickly a city can shift between confidence and panic.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">A city full of teachers</h2>

        <p>
          Athens was not only a political center. It was an intellectual marketplace.
          Sophists — traveling teachers — offered training in argument, speech, and civic success.
          They asked provocative questions: What is virtue? Can it be taught? Is justice natural, or only a convention? :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
        </p>

        <p>
          For a young person, this could be exciting and unsettling.
          Traditional values were still present, but they were being challenged in public.
          In Plato’s later work, you will often feel a response to this atmosphere:
          the need for standards that do not collapse into mere opinion.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">Society and education</h2>

        <p>
          Athens was structured by sharp boundaries.
          Full citizens held political rights. Many residents were <em>metics</em> (foreigners living in the city), without citizenship.
          A large enslaved population supported the economy and household life. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
        </p>

        <p>
          Elite education combined two pillars:
          <strong>mousikē</strong> (music, poetry, formation of character) and
          <strong>gymnastikē</strong> (physical training).
          This was not “school” in the modern sense.
          It was a way of shaping a person for civic life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Plato was born into privilege, and he would have received the best version of this formation.
          But privilege came with expectations: aristocratic families often believed they were meant to lead.
          That background matters when we later read his criticism of democracy and his vision of education in the <em>Republic</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin studying Plato, it helps to keep this image in mind:
          a brilliant city, crowded with art, politics, and argument —
          beautiful, ambitious, and heading toward a crisis.
