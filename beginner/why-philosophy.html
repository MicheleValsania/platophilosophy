      <h1>Why Philosophy Exists</h1>
      
      <article class="reading">
        
        <p>
          Mathematics has proven its theorems. Physics has confirmed its laws. Medicine has cured diseases. These disciplines produce results that close questions: the Pythagorean theorem is settled, the speed of light is measured, antibiotics work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Philosophy, after 2,500 years, is still discussing the same questions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is not a failure. It is the point.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Philosophy does not seek answers that close debates. It seeks questions that open understanding. And the questions Plato asked—about justice, knowledge, reality, the good life—remain open not because philosophers are incompetent, but because these questions are <em>ineliminable</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You cannot live without taking a position on them, whether you articulate that position or not. You act as if some things are worth pursuing and others are not. You treat some claims as knowledge and others as opinion. You organize your life around implicit answers to philosophical questions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Philosophy makes those implicit answers explicit. It examines them. It tests their coherence. It asks whether they can withstand scrutiny.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The difference between science and philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>
          Science investigates the world as it is. It measures, experiments, builds models. When a scientific question is answered definitively, it stops being a live question. We no longer debate whether the Earth orbits the Sun or whether atoms exist.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Philosophy investigates the concepts we use to make sense of the world. What do we mean by "justice"? What counts as "knowledge"? What is the relationship between mind and body? These are not questions that can be resolved by observation or experiment, because they are questions about the <em>frameworks</em> within which observation and experiment make sense.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This does not mean philosophy is subjective or arbitrary. Philosophical arguments can be better or worse, more or less coherent, more or less comprehensive. But they operate at a different level than empirical inquiry.
        </p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
          <strong>Key point:</strong> Philosophy examines the concepts and assumptions that other disciplines take for granted. It asks not "what is true?" but "what do we mean when we say something is true?"
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why these questions stay open</h2>
        
        <p>
          Some questions remain open because human life is complex and contexts change. What justice requires in one situation may differ from what it requires in another. The concepts themselves—justice, knowledge, beauty—are not fixed objects waiting to be discovered. They are tools we use to navigate reality, and their meaning shifts as our understanding deepens.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Plato understood this. His dialogues rarely conclude with a final, settled answer. They end with new questions, refined definitions, or an acknowledgment that more work is needed. This is not evasion. It is intellectual honesty.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The value of philosophy is not in arriving at certainty. It is in <em>clarifying the terms of the problem</em>. After reading Plato on justice, you will not have a formula for resolving every moral dilemma. But you will understand what is at stake when you make a choice. You will see the underlying tensions that make difficult decisions difficult.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What to expect from this path</h2>
        
        <p>
          This beginner's path will introduce you to how Plato thought, why he wrote in dialogues, and what makes his approach distinctive. It will not give you a summary of "Plato's philosophy" as if it were a doctrine to memorize. It will give you the tools to read Plato yourself—to follow his arguments, test his conclusions, and think through the questions he raises.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The next five pages will cover:
        </p>
        
        <ul style="margin:16px 0;padding-left:24px;line-height:1.8;">
          <li>What makes Plato different from other philosophers</li>
          <li>Why he wrote in dialogue form</li>
          <li>How the Socratic method works</li>
          <li>The difference between reading and being told</li>
          <li>Where to begin once you've finished this path</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          This will take about 30 minutes. You can read straight through or return later. There is no test at the end. The goal is not to absorb information but to prepare your mind for a certain kind of reading—one that requires patience, attention, and a willingness to think slowly.
