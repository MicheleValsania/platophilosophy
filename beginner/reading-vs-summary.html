      <h1>Reading vs Being Told</h1>
      <article class="reading">
        <p>You can read a hundred summaries of the <em>Republic</em>. You can watch YouTube videos that explain the Theory of Forms in five minutes. You can skim SparkNotes before class.</p>
        <p>This is not the same as reading Plato.</p>
        <h2>Content vs process</h2>
        <p>A summary gives you conclusions: "Plato believed in Forms," "Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge," "The ideal city has three classes." These are not wrong. But they are not philosophy.</p>
        <p>Philosophy is not the set of conclusions. It is the process of arriving at conclusions—the arguments, the objections, the refinements. When you read a summary, you get the destination. When you read Plato, you travel the road.</p>
        <p>And the road is what teaches you to think.</p>
        <div class="key-point">
          <strong>Key point:</strong> The value of reading philosophy is not in learning what Plato concluded but in following how he reasoned. That process is what trains your mind.
        </div>
        <h2>Why dialogues require time</h2>
        <p>Platonic dialogues are not efficient. They meander. Characters interrupt. Arguments get revisited. Socrates asks seemingly obvious questions and spends pages drawing out implications.</p>
        <p>This feels slow if you are impatient for answers. But the slowness is deliberate. Plato is not trying to convey information quickly. He is modeling a way of thinking: careful, methodical, willing to pause and examine assumptions.</p>
        <p>You cannot learn this from a summary. You must experience it in real time—following the dialogue as it unfolds, noticing when an objection is raised, seeing why a particular response matters. This takes patience. But it is the only way to internalize the method.</p>
        <h2>The value of slow reading</h2>
        <p>Modern culture rewards speed. Read faster, consume more, move on. Philosophy requires the opposite: slow down, reread, sit with difficult passages.</p>
        <p>When Socrates makes a move that seems odd—asking "What is X?" when everyone already "knows"—you should pause and ask why. When a dialogue ends without a clear conclusion, resist the urge to declare it unsatisfying. Ask what work the <em>aporia</em> is doing.</p>
        <p>Slow reading is not about being thorough for thoroughness's sake. It is about giving your mind time to process complex ideas. Philosophy is conceptually dense. You cannot skim it the way you skim news articles.</p>
        <h2>How this site helps (and its limits)</h2>
        <p>This project provides context: historical background, explanations of terms, guides to individual dialogues. These resources are meant to make primary texts more accessible, not to replace them.</p>
        <p>Use this site to understand <em>who</em> Plato was, <em>when</em> he wrote, <em>why</em> certain questions mattered in ancient Athens. Then read the dialogues themselves. The context helps, but it is not a substitute for the text.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way: If you are about to visit a foreign country, a guidebook is useful. It tells you about the culture, the history, what to expect. But the guidebook is not the trip. You still have to go.</p>
        <p>The same applies here. This site is the guidebook. Plato's dialogues are the trip.</p>
        <h2>Reading recommendations</h2>
        <p>If you are new to Plato, start with shorter, earlier dialogues:</p>
        <ul style="margin:16px 0;padding-left:24px;line-height:1.8;">
          <li><strong>Apology</strong> (30 minutes) — Socrates' defense at trial</li>
          <li><strong>Crito</strong> (20 minutes) — Should Socrates escape from prison?</li>
          <li><strong>Euthyphro</strong> (25 minutes) — What is piety?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are accessible, dramatic, and introduce the Socratic method in action. Once you have read these, you will have a sense of how Plato writes and whether his style appeals to you.</p>
        <p>After that, the middle dialogues (<em>Meno</em>, <em>Phaedo</em>, <em>Symposium</em>, <em>Republic</em>) develop his positive philosophy. The late dialogues (<em>Parmenides</em>, <em>Sophist</em>, <em>Timaeus</em>) are more technical and self-critical.</p>
        <p>But the order matters less than the commitment to reading slowly, attentively, and with a willingness to be puzzled.</p>
